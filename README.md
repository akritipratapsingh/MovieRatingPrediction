# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project is a part of my internship at codeSoft, where I worked on predictive modeling using the IMDb India Movies dataset. The objective of this project is to build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. Regression techniques are employed to tackle this problem, aiming to accurately estimate the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies). It comprises information about Indian movies from IMDb, including features like movie name, year, director, and actors. This dataset provides a rich source of information for analyzing historical movie data and developing predictive models for movie ratings.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict the rating of a movie using features like genre, director, and actors.
- **Approach**: Employ regression techniques to build a predictive model based on the provided dataset.
- **Tools and Libraries**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtained the IMDb India Movies dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored the dataset to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with movie ratings.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features from the dataset and performed transformations to improve model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Utilized regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, etc., to build and train the predictive model.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared score, etc.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuned the parameters of the chosen model to optimize its performance.
8. **Final Model Selection**: Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Results
The trained model achieved satisfactory performance in predicting movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors. Detailed evaluation metrics and results are documented in the project's code and reports.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable experience in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques. The predictive model built as part of this project can be further refined and deployed for practical use cases in the movie industry.
